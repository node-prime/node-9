Hi,

CrisF here.


**[node-9](https://node9.xyz)** is one of the many candidates running for election as KMD Notary Node operator in the EU region.


Your support and any VOTE2019 sent to **RBDivEArcb7aRsYTvtN5MRnaxeDAepSNmW** would really be appreciated.


I'm actively working in *[KMDLabs](https://kmdlabs.io)*, a R&D platform testing and developing the very edge of KMD technologies.  You can imagine the effect this development will have on the entire Komodo ecosystem. This work will touch every aspect of Komodo and will go a long way towards attracting new developers, projects and investors to Komodo Platform.  I'll be donating a portion of node earnings to this project.

KMDLabs has its own 2nd Tier Notary Node network used for NN network dev ops and to secure its test chains and clusters.  I have been running a Notary Node on this network since its inception. 

With this experience I can confidently say this: I'll be there, I'll do the work and I'll push limits. 

Information on the node-9 election proposal can be found here: **[node-9](https://node9.xyz)**

I'd be grateful for any VOTE2019 you send. 

Thanks,

CrisF
