# KMD NN Elections 2019

## It's official, node-9 won a place!

![Official results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/node-prime/node-9/master/2019%20NN%20Election%20Results%20(official).png)

The new Notaries will take their places with the KMD hardfork, around the end of June / start of July.

Until then it will be a busy month and a half of preparing and optimizing the server and getting in more practice.  The first month or two of mainnet should be quite intense with a lot to learn and do.

There will be many more chains to notarize with some very talented and experienced NN operators.  During this preparation time new strategies and tactics will need to be developed.

The election is now over, but your contact is always welcome.  Feel free to reach out anytime.  Happy to hear from you.

Thank you very much for your support!

## Results (unofficial)
### node-9 won a spot!!

![Unofficial results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/node-prime/node-9/master/2019%20NN%20Election%20Results%20(unofficial).png)

## Thank you!

I am deeply humbled and grateful for all of the support that node-9 has received.  The election was very tight in the EU region and your VOTE2019 really counted.  Thank you very much.

The support node-9 has received goes back far beyond these elections.

One year ago I watched the Notary Node elections and thought to myself how cool it would be to play a part in supporting such a cause. I fantasized of myself having such a role. A pleasant distraction from the troubles I was having operating a simple GUI and navigating Slack.

The patience, help and encouragement that have been so freely given by the Komodo community and certain members in particular is a testament to the character of this project and the importance of its purpose.

To me the thing that has shone through the brightest in all of this has been people's willingness to give an 'anybody' a chance.  

I didn't expect that.

This experience has shown me a big part of what the 'blockchain revolution' and, more specifically, the Komodo project is about. It is something worth fighting for and I'll stand up and do my part. 

Thank you for giving me this hope and opportunity, and for your support.

CrisF


### Vote Bounty!
Many thanks go out to Kolo for his generous bounty of 50,000 VOTE2019!  Thank you and all the others who have given their support.

)

It was a busy week working on the new server and dealing with some downtime. The cause of this trouble is still under investigation.  It made for a 40-hour-day early in the week.  Not fun, but good practice and experience for when things get real on Mainnet.  The goal for the week is to continue optimizations on the new server and prepare for the big push during the final week of voting.  Again, keeping node-9 around the top of the lead pack is a priority. 

### Success
node-9 hit its target!


![Testnet bounty winner announcement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/node-prime/node-9/master/results.png)

The goal for last week was to have the most overall notarizations on testnet and claim [Decker's bounty](#testnet). At approximately 11:45pm(UTC) Sunday 20 April, with 15 minutes to spare, node-9 was able to edge past the previous leader after a week-long chase.  That lead has been slowly increasing.  Still a long, long way to go but nice to have a small victory to celebrate.

Very grateful to all of those people who have given their time, knowledge and support to show me the way. I'm standing on the backs of giants here.  Will keep on doing my part.

This coming week the plan is to maintain a notarization rate along with the top of the pack and get the new server up for testing and optimization.  Fun and frustration expected :)


### Testnet

node-9 is running well on testnet.  Decker has kindly put up a bounty for the most total notarizations at the end of this week, finishing on Sunday, 21 April.  That will be the next target.  It will be a difficult goal to reach with 2 strong candidates out in front.  A week is a long time though and much can happen :)

![Decker's Bounty](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/node-prime/node-9/master/Deckers_bounty.png)

You can follow node-9's testnet stats here (node-9 is labeled as "CrisF")  :

Testnet Stats:   [https://notarystats.info/testnet.php?period=all](https://notarystats.info/testnet.php?period=all)
   

It is possible that the node-9 server may be upgraded over the coming weekend. It will take some time to optimize and may involve some downtime, so servers may not be switched until after claiming Decker's bounty ;)   Fingers crossed.

In this proposal I talk about myself a lot.  That just seems to be the clearest way to express what I am offering.  Please don't think I'm a narcissistic megalomaniac.
I am in fact far, far better than that.  
:wink: :wink:

### How to participate
Information on how the NN elections work and how to vote can be found on the [Komodo website, here](https://komodoplatform.com/third-annual-notary-node-election/) and on [Komodoelection.com](https://komodoelection.com).  One KMD earns one vote token. It is possible to send portions of your vote tokens to multiple candidates. 

# Proposal

### Region: EU

### Purpose

As a Komodo EU Notary I will focus on notarizing.  Notarizing to the highest level I am able.  I will also support others in doing the same.  I believe that what we are creating here with Komodo is a very important step in the right direction.  As such, I take the responsibility of the role of Notary Node operator very seriously.
  
### Method

I will reliably put in the time and effort to do the best job I can possibly do.  This means being available when needed for updates, support and for active participation in the notary node community.  It also means I will do my best to improve my skills and hardware continually throughout the entire one year term.  Although these concepts may sound trivial and common, they are in fact not.  I believe my record, found through search or by asking around, will show that I am capable and willing to make this happen.

### Means
Through the use of a network of support I have developed and with the experience, skills and knowledge I have gained through working in KMDLabs as a Notary Node operator and basic tester I will continually optimize my node throughout the year, regardless of my notarization standings. I am not a dev or a very technical person but I have found out where and how to find and implement solutions to technical problems.

### Biography

The below accomplishments are very minor, without a doubt.  If you consider a start with absolute zero skill or knowledge of anything to do with computers, let alone blockchain and crypto, these accomplishments may take on a different perspective.

- mm1 stress test - received bug bounty for finding and reporting bug
- scaling test - one of very few to send a txBlast, participating where possible
- Pos64tests - actively participated in tests. Found minor bugs.  Only one to set up CC (dice) outside of 'official' test contract. 
- minor participation in PIRATE
  * setup a test chain for PIRATE NN tests (not used)
  * involved in deciding change to the current block reward
  * involved in PIRATE notarization testing in KMDLabs
- provide assistance in Discord ```'LANGUAGES AND LOCATIONS' #japanese``` channel
- KMDLabs
  * active participation in community
  * basic testing on setup of Labs
  * basic testing on first CCs
  * built and maintain [KMDLabs website](https://kmdlabs.com)
  * wrote, compiled or edited majority of content for website
  * setup and maintain [KMDLabs pad](https://kmdlabs.cc)
  * perform various non-dev jobs so devs can get on with devving
  
- basic testing on Marmara chain
- assisted in early Marmara documentation work
- mm2 community tester
- active in various KMD channels
- actively working with KMD team, outside of the online world, to bring business to KMD and its ecosystem

### Node
The exact details of the node I will be using will be finalized, should I be elected, after the election but well before going live on mainnet.  I expect an influx of new assetchains and and projects requiring dPoW over the coming year and will spec the server to meet this demand.  

Minimum specifications will be as follows:

| Specs | Details |
| ------ | ------ |
| CPU | Xeon/i7 (or equivalent AMD) |
| RAM | 128GB DDR4 ECC |
| Storage| 2 x 1TB SSD|
| Network | 1 Gbps |
| Location | EU datacentre |

### Pledge

If elected as a KMD Notary Node operator I pledge to donate 20% of the KMD mined by the node to [KMDLabs](https://kmdlabs.com) to be used to improve their infrastructure and their support for development initiatives.   

> [KMDLabs](https://kmdlabs.com) is a 'not for profit' testing ground for R&D
>  work on Komodo (KMD), Komodo based assetchains
> and Crypto-Conditions contracts. It also provides an
> incentivized test network, technical services and support
> knowledge base that will attract and onboard projects
> and developers to the Komodo ecosystem. It is not a
> business, but aims to provide free and very low cost
> services for development on the Komodo Platform.

### The Point

The point of this embarrassing self-aggrandizement is to give you one simple picture.

**```I'll be there, I'll do the work and I'll push limits.```**

Please send votes my way.
