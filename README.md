### Testnet

node-9 is running well on testnet.  Decker has kindly put up a bounty for the most total notarizations at the end of this week, finishing on Sunday, 21 April.  That will be the next target.  It will be a difficult goal to reach with 2 strong candidates out in front.  A week is a long time though and much can happen :)

You can follow node-9's testnet stats here (node-9 is labeled as "CrisF"):

It is possible that the node-9 server may be upgraded over the coming weekend. It will take some time to optimize and may involve some downtime, so servers may not be switched until after claiming Decker's bounty ;)   Fingers crossed.

In this proposal I talk about myself a lot.  That just seems to be the clearest way to express what I am offering.  Please don't think I'm a narcissistic megalomaniac.
I am in fact far, far better than that.  
:wink: :wink:

### How to participate
Information on how the NN elections work and how to vote can be found on the [Komodo website, here](https://komodoplatform.com/third-annual-notary-node-election/) and on [Komodoelection.com](https://komodoelection.com).  One KMD earns one vote token. It is possible to send portions of your vote tokens to multiple candidates. 

# Proposal

### Region: EU

### Purpose

As a Komodo EU Notary I will focus on notarizing.  Notarizing to the highest level I am able.  I will also support others in doing the same.  I believe that what we are creating here with Komodo is a very important step in the right direction.  As such, I take the responsibility of the role of Notary Node operator very seriously.
  
### Method

I will reliably put in the time and effort to do the best job I can possibly do.  This means being available when needed for updates, support and for active participation in the notary node community.  It also means I will do my best to improve my skills and hardware continually throughout the entire one year term.  Although these concepts may sound trivial and common, they are in fact not.  I believe my record, found through search or by asking around, will show that I am capable and willing to make this happen.

### Means
Through the use of a network of support I have developed and with the experience, skills and knowledge I have gained through working in KMDLabs as a Notary Node operator and basic tester I will continually optimize my node throughout the year, regardless of my notarization standings. I am not a dev or a very technical person but I have found out where and how to find and implement solutions to technical problems.

### Biography

The below accomplishments are very minor, without a doubt.  If you consider a start with absolute zero skill or knowledge of anything to do with computers, let alone blockchain and crypto, these accomplishments may take on a different perspective.

- mm1 stress test - received bug bounty for finding and reporting bug
- scaling test - one of very few to send a txBlast, participating where possible
- Pos64tests - actively participated in tests. Found minor bugs.  Only one to set up CC (dice) outside of 'official' test contract. 
- minor participation in PIRATE
  * setup a test chain for PIRATE NN tests (not used)
  * involved in deciding change to the current block reward
  * involved in PIRATE notarization testing in KMDLabs
- provide assistance in Discord ```'LANGUAGES AND LOCATIONS' #japanese``` channel
- KMDLabs
  * active participation in community
  * basic testing on setup of Labs
  * basic testing on first CCs
  * built and maintain [KMDLabs website](https://kmdlabs.com)
  * wrote, compiled or edited majority of content for website
  * setup and maintain [KMDLabs pad](https://kmdlabs.cc)
  * perform various non-dev jobs so devs can get on with devving
  
- basic testing on Marmara chain
- assisted in early Marmara documentation work
- mm2 community tester
- active in various KMD channels
- actively working with KMD team, outside of the online world, to bring business to KMD and its ecosystem

### Node
The exact details of the node I will be using will be finalized, should I be elected, after the election but well before going live on mainnet.  I expect an influx of new assetchains and and projects requiring dPoW over the coming year and will spec the server to meet this demand.  

Minimum specifications will be as follows:

| Specs | Details |
| ------ | ------ |
| CPU | Xeon/i7 (or equivalent AMD) |
| RAM | 128GB DDR4 ECC |
| Storage| 2 x 1TB SSD purpose|
| Network | 1 Gbps |
| Location | EU datacentre |

### Pledge

If elected as a KMD Notary Node operator I pledge to donate 20% of the KMD mined by the node to [KMDLabs](https://kmdlabs.com) to be used to improve their infrastructure and their support for development initiatives.   

> [KMDLabs](https://kmdlabs.com) is a 'not for profit' testing ground for R&D
>  work on Komodo (KMD), Komodo based assetchains
> and Crypto-Conditions contracts. It also provides an
> incentivized test network, technical services and support
> knowledge base that will attract and onboard projects
> and developers to the Komodo ecosystem. It is not a
> business, but aims to provide free and very low cost
> services for development on the Komodo Platform.

### The Point

The point of this embarrassing self-aggrandizement is to give you one simple picture.

**```I'll be there, I'll do the work and I'll push limits.```**

Please send votes my way.
